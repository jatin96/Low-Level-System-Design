## General guidelines

Questions to ask:

1. What type of app are we designing
    - web app/apis
    - entity/only class diagram
    - commandline
    - Desktop app (no need to persist), no need to divide in controller, repository etc.
2. Do we need to persist the data
3. How will we take the input? through API or command line
4. Ask about edge cases
