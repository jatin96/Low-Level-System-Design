# Factory Design Pattern

- Used when there is tight coupling. On the basis of input, we want the creation of the objects.
- Eg. making db connections to jdbc, postgressql
- I am creating an instance of a subclass without the client knowing about it.

## Types of factory
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory


## Factory Method
- multiple subclasses
- decide which subclass to instantiate on a parameter
- return the interface
