# Decorator pattern

I have a base functionality and I am adding more layers to add additional functionality.
Eg : 
- You had a pizza base
- You add tomato sauce
- You add cheese over pizza
- You add toppings on the pizza

More formally, you have a base entity. You are adding new behaviour. We still have the original entity.
We are 'decorating' the entity.

This is also called wrapper design pattern.

Without modifying your base entity you are modifying the behaviour.
